In the first project I analyzed the finacial records of "my company" 

I found the number of months and the total profits of that company, including the average change per month

I also found which months had the greatest increases and decreases

In the second project I helped find the winner of a local election

I found how many votes there were along with how many each contestant got. This also told me the percentage

From there I found the winner
